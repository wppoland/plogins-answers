Add per-product FAQs as an accessible accordion to reduce pre-sale questions.

== Description ==

Answers adds a frequently-asked-questions section to your WooCommerce products,
so shoppers can read the common pre-sale questions on the product page instead of
emailing to ask.

You write the FAQs in a "FAQs" tab inside the WooCommerce Product data panel using
a question/answer repeater. They show up in their own "FAQs" tab on the single
product page, next to Description and Reviews.

The front-end FAQs are an **accessible accordion**. Each question is a real
`<button>` with `aria-expanded` controlling an `aria`-labelled region, so it works
with the keyboard and is announced correctly by screen readers. Panels open and
close with a height transition that is switched off under `prefers-reduced-motion`,
the answer text stays reachable when JavaScript is off, and the styling follows the
visitor's light or dark colour scheme.

= Features =

* Per-product FAQ items, authored in a "FAQs" product data tab.
* Accordion built from a `<button>` plus an `aria`-labelled region: keyboard operable, visible focus ring, `aria-expanded` kept in sync.
* Shows in its own "FAQs" product-information tab; the tab label is editable.
* Answers accept basic HTML, sanitised with `wp_kses_post` on save and again on output.
* CSS custom properties for theming, a dark-scheme palette, and motion that respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
* Front-end assets load only on product pages that actually have FAQs.
* Translation ready (POT included), and removes its options on uninstall.
* Declares HPOS and cart/checkout blocks compatibility.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to `/wp-content/plugins/answers`, or install via Plugins → Add New.
2. Activate it. WooCommerce must be active.
3. Edit a product and open the **FAQs** tab to add questions.
4. Rename the FAQ tab under **WooCommerce → Answers** if you like.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it require WooCommerce? =

Yes. WooCommerce must be installed and active.

= Where do FAQs appear? =

In a dedicated "FAQs" product-information tab on the single product page.

= Is the accordion accessible? =

Yes. Each question is a button with `aria-expanded` controlling an `aria`-labelled
region, it is keyboard operable, has visible focus, and respects reduced-motion.

= Can I use HTML in answers? =

Basic HTML allowed by `wp_kses_post` (links, lists, emphasis). Scripts are stripped on save and output.

= Does it load assets on every product page? =

No. CSS and JS load only on products that have at least one FAQ saved.


= Does this plugin work on WordPress Multisite? =

Yes. This plugin is compatible with WordPress Multisite. Network activate it or activate it on individual sites; each site keeps its own settings and data.

== Screenshots ==

1. The FAQ accordion on a product page.
2. The per-product FAQs tab in the product data panel.
3. The Answers settings screen under WooCommerce.

== External Services ==

Answers does not connect to any external service. It makes no outbound HTTP
requests, and loads no third-party scripts, fonts, or stylesheets; its CSS and
JavaScript are served from the plugin folder only. The FAQ content you write is
stored entirely on your own site: per-product items in the `_answers_faqs` post
meta and plugin settings in the `answers_settings` option (with a schema marker
in `answers_db_version`). Nothing is sent off-site, and the plugin sends no email.

== Translations ==

Plogins Answers includes Polish, German and Spanish translations for the plugin interface. The text domain is `plogins-answers`, so WordPress.org language packs can also override or extend these bundled translations.
